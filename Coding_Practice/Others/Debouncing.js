// Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time. 
// When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until 
// after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called. 
// You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before â€” when entering an elevator. 
// Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button (the debounced function not being called) 
// will the elevator door actually close (the callback function is executed).

// Implement a debounce function which accepts a callback function and a wait duration. Calling debounce() 
// returns a function which has debounced invocations of the callback function following the behavior described above.

function debounce(func, wait){
    let timer;         //stores timerId 
    return function(...args){     // returns a debounced function
    clearTimeout(timer);                    // clears existing timeout
    timer = setTimeout(()=>{
        func.apply(this, args);         // apply method calls the function with this value and args as an array.
    },wait)
    };
}

function increment(){
    console.log("+1");
}

const result = debounce(increment, 1000);

console.log(result());
